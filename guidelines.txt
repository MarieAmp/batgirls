Coding Icebreaker

For this game, you will be randomly assigned to a team of 2 :)

It's a 1 hour rush !!!

Use HTML + CSS ( + JS if you want) to code a simple web-page presenting the team members.

You will need to collaborate remotely, so use github to synchronise your work ! 

A) One team member is in charge to create a remote repo on github
B) He/She will assign the other team member(s) to the remote repo (see repo/settings/manage access)
C) Each team member should clone the repo and do a part of the job
D) Communicate and code a cool page (the who, when, what, how, hobbies, music ... )
E) Present you work !


Each team will make a quick presentation of the page
Each team member will present the other one !
