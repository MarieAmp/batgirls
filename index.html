            <li>Who</li>
            <p> My name is Charlotte but you can call me Cha, I'm 28 (29 pretty soon).</p>
            <li>What</li>
            <p> I have always worked in tech and also always so how powerful coding can be.<br>
                I used to be an Office Manager, then Admin HR & Finance Manager, but it became really tiring and unexciting :( <br>
                I want to be able to give life to all my crazy and not so crazy ideas.</p>
            <li>How</li>
            <p>This is the main reason I want to learn how to code, and especially JS. <br>
                It's a complete abd powerfull toolset to get strated, see the first results and get hungry for more !</p>
            <li>Hobbies</li>
            <p>Painting, Cooking, and every culture thing that can be meta </p>
            <li>Music</li>
            <p>Mostly old stuff, really cheesy songs, and most French 80s I know by heart.</p>
        </ul>
